        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Lizeth Espana, second-year alumni at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in Pre-Business in hopes of working towards a concentration in accounting. My hometown is Downtown, Los Angeles where I currently live with both my parents and younger brother. As a first-generation Latina, I am the first one in my family to graduate high school and continue to post-secondary education. Throughout my high school years and first year of college, I have had an interest in pursuing a degree in Business specifically going into the field of accounting. Having an interest in math, working with numbers, and analyzing has made me decide that I want to pursue accounting where I would be able to put into practice these tasks. An accountant not only helps maintain important financial records but also makes sure that it follows regulations and laws. I believe that accounting is the major for me since I like clerical work and would also like to work for a company in which I would work with their finances and help people. 
<br><br>

         During the summer of 2019, I did an internship with the Office of Congressman, Jimmy Gomez where I work together with the staff of Los Angeles and the ones from the DC office. In that internship, I learned to strengthen my communication, organization, and soft skills. As an intern some of the tasks included working on creating spreadsheets, answering and passing along messages to staff, working on projects, and setting up for events. In the course of these hours, I gained more confidence in my communication skills since I was taught how to answer phone calls and deliver messages appropriately. Additionally, during some occasions, I was also placed at the front desk where I would greet constituents and get them the right staff that would help them according to their situation. Soft skills were put into practice because I would also be asked to translate messages from English to Spanish when making pamphlets or asked to organize closed cases alphabetically and other sources of information. 
<br><br>

        Furthermore, I then proceeded to work at a restaurant called Gussâ€™s Drive-In where I worked for two months as a cashier. This job required me to attend the front register to take orders and provide the right amount of change to customers. Some of the other duties were to clean around the workspace, help in the drive-thru with packaging, deliver orders to customers, and take orders outside. Depending on the time scheduled sometimes I was asked to open in the mornings or help close at night and count the total money earned. Communication was the main thing since we had to make sure we took the order correctly and if any mistakes were made then make sure to come up with a solution. Apart from taking orders either from the register, drive-thru, or tablet we also had to help the preparing of flatware for the following day. Moreover, I also managed to become a part of the UCR Trio Program where I am able to get mentoring from peer mentors and academic advisors. This has been a very helpful experience since I get advice from third and fourth-year students who motivate me to stay on top of classes. In this program, they have workshops and career speakers that share interesting information and achievements throughout their career which inspires me to someday do the same.
